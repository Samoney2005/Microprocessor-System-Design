# ECE 3223 – Microprocessor System Design (Spring 2026)

This repository contains my programming projects and supporting code for **ECE 3223: Microprocessor System Design** at the **University of Oklahoma**.

The projects in this repository are developed using **Arm Mbed** and focus on embedded software design in **C/C++** for microcontrollers.

## Learning Objectives
By completing the projects in this repository, I will be able to:
- Write and debug embedded software for microcontrollers
- Interface LEDs, switches, and analog devices
- Work with PWM, timers, and interrupts
- Implement SPI and I2C communication
- Use low-level registers for digital I/O
- Design address decoders for microprocessor systems
